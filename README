# Hangman (C++)

A simple **console-based Hangman game written in C++**, built as a learning project using basic STL features, file I/O, and classes.

---

## Features

- Random word selection from a word list
- ASCII hangman display
- Guess tracking and remaining chances
- Save & load system
- Restart or continue previous games
- Clean separation of logic (display, helpers, save, game)

---

## How It Works

- Words are loaded from `google-10000-english-usa.txt`
- A word is randomly selected (5–12 characters)
- The player guesses letters until:
  - the word is fully revealed ✅
  - or chances run out ❌
- Game state can be saved and reloaded from `save.txt`
